Even though the challenge ended up with a few solves, there isn’t much to be said about it.

I basically dug through the entire Discord server searching for leads, until I accidentally discovered that when trying to send a sticker in **#general_en**, there was actually a hidden QR code in one of them. I tried scanning it myself but couldn’t get it to work, neither on my phone nor through Python scripts.

In the end, I sent it over to one of my teammates, and hilariously, he managed to scan it immediately with his phone and recover the flag.
