First of all when i saw the image i imediately loaded it in Aperisolve to see what i can get without much effort.
Then I took a look around there and saw the .onion link and there and just accesed it.In the source code of the page i saw that there
is a custom font used so i downloaded it and briefly analyzed it. Using strings i saw that there is something like "MmQgMmQgMm" which translates to  "2d 2d 2d 2d 2d 20 2e 2d 2" meaning the hex codes for "-" and "." meaning that there is a morse code.
The whole thing translates to "https://www.google.com/maps/place/ARChA/@45.7450165,21.225122,17z/data=!4m16!1m9!3m8!1s0x47455d9b87725af1:0x7a82191592d97493!2sARChA!8m2!3d45.7450165!4d21.2277023!9m1!1b1!16s%2Fg%2F11vbtv2ys4!3m5!1s0x47455d9b87725af1:0x7a82191592d97493!8m2!3d45.7450165!4d21.2277023!16s%2Fg%2F11vbtv2ys4?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDkxMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" which has a photo that contains a qr(the flag)
