Well at first glance i thought that i have to put the isLogged cookie true but i was wrong.
But there was actually something i did with that cookie: "curl -s -v http://ctf.ac.upt.ro:9465/login \
  -H "Cookie: logged_in=True; session=978fa8b1-8dff-4239-8395-5733c8ed44c2.y97WYSrEJ78X6o6v0Xt2HCM-M"
" which revealed me that there is a /gallery endpoint. So i went there without bothering to change the values of the cookies in my browser and I saw some photos and i searched for a qr and found one again:)
That s pretty much it. Thanks a lot for the organizers
