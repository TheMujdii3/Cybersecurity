At first I assumed I needed to set the `isLogged` cookie to `true`, but that wasnâ€™t it. What did help was curling the login endpoint with the provided cookies:

```bash
curl -s -v http://ctf.ac.upt.ro:9465/login \
  -H "Cookie: logged_in=True; session=978fa8b1-8dff-4239-8395-5733c8ed44c2.y97WYSrEJ78X6o6v0Xt2HCM-M"
```

The response revealed a `/gallery` endpoint. I visited it in the browser without bothering to change the cookie values and found several photos, one of which contained a QR code. Scanning that QR gave a ***pastebin* link.
