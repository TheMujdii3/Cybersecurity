Out of pure laziness I didn’t bother writing a decoding script myself. Instead, I handed the challenge to my “brother” ChatGPT, and after some trial-and-error decoding attempts it eventually produced the correct flag.

I actually saw 3–4 different candidate flags in that chat, and I don’t even remember exactly which one turned out to be the valid one. For proof though, here’s the link to the GPT session:
