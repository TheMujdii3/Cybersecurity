Because of my lazyness to code a decoding script I used my brother gpt to decode the flag for me and he really did a good job with some trial and error decoding.
I got 3 or 4 diffrent flags in the chat and i dont really remember which one was the good one but for proof I will leave a link
of my gpt chat here.
