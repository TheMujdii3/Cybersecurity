I actually solved this one during my physics class, mostly out of boredom. I downloaded the challenge photo on my phone and ran a quick **Google reverse image search**.

Among the very first results was a link to [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/Share-RrlQn39), which contained the **original photo (or parts of it)** in its listing images. That confirmed the location and led me straight to the solution.
