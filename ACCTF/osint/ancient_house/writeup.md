For this challenge i used chatgpt("https://chatgpt.com/share/68cbe101-3f0c-8006-86a9-93d3416f5261") again for reconstructing the image. 
As a result i got almost the same image but i knew that it was wrong because the color in the top left corner was green instead of yellowish.
So i tried to use google search but it didnt work at all and then i tried yandex search which also didnt get it right but it gave me a list of photos similar to that one.
Between a list of useless photos there was this one wikipedia article "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ROU_TM_Dumbrava_CoA.jpg" which was actually good and flag related.
