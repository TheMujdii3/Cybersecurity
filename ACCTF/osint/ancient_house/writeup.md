For this challenge I leaned on **ChatGPT** ([share link](https://chatgpt.com/share/68cbe101-3f0c-8006-86a9-93d3416f5261)) to help reconstruct the corrupted image. The result was close, but I realized it was off because the top-left corner showed green instead of the expected yellowish color.

I then tried **Google reverse image search**, but it returned nothing useful. **Yandex** didnâ€™t pinpoint it either, but at least gave me a list of similar-looking images. Among those results I stumbled upon a **Wikipedia Commons page**: [ROU\_TM\_Dumbrava\_CoA](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ROU_TM_Dumbrava_CoA.jpg), which turned out to be the right lead and directly related to the flag.
