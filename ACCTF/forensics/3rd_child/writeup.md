I loaded the `.wav` file into **Audacity**, expecting to uncover the flag in spectrogram form—and that’s exactly what happened.

After switching each output to **spectrogram view**, I noticed that the **third track contained the flag**, so I eliminated the first two. By adjusting the spectrogram range to **700–4000 Hz**, the hidden flag became clearly visible, just like in the screenshot.
