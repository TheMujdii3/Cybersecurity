I immediately loaded the .wav file in audacity hoping that i would get the flag in spectanogram form and this was it.
I switched each output to spectanogram and observed that the 3rd one contains the flag so i eliminated the first 2 outputs and put some limits for the spectanogram 700-4000 and got the flag like in screenshot.
