This challenge was especially fun since I hold a ham radio operator license and immediately recognized the callsign.

* **Callsign:** `YO2TSS`
* From the callsign, I retrieved the **QTH locator:** `KN15KS`.
* Using the site [qsl.design](https://qsl.design/en/find-qth-locator/), I converted the locator into the corresponding city and obtained the solution.
